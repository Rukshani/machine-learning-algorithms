#1. Linear Regression
    * The mathematical technique to find a line (or curve) that best matches the points of data
    that you collected is called regression.

#2. KNN Classification
    * KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) is a simple supervised classification algorithm we can use to assign a class to new data point.
     It can be used for regression as well, KNN does not make any assumptions on the data distribution, hence it is non-parametric.

# The Equation of the line
    * Most people have learned the form of a linear equation as y = mx + b (slope-intercept form),
    where m = slope and b = y-intercept (where the graph intersects with the y-axis).

# The Correlation
    * Correlation is a measue of how close the line fits the points that you found in your experiment.
    If R=1, then the line perfectly matches the points, so the goal is to get this number close to 1.
